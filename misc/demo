## API Problems

1. API schema defines few attributes as int or bool, but the API returns string.
   1. managed_device: http_port, https_port, use_global_setting_for_communication_with_ns
2. Some API resources do not exactly match with that of the body resources. esp., stylebook APIs
   1. `configpacks` in URL --> `configpack` in body
   2. `jobs` in URL --> `job` in body
3. license_allocation: the immediate READ (GET) after license allocation gives empty value for license_edition and plt_bw_config
